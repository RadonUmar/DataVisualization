# Racecar Data Analysis Website

A lightweight web app for uploading, parsing, and visualizing racecar telemetry data. Built with Next.js, shadcn/ui + TailwindCSS, PapaParse, and Chart.js. Enhanced with Gemini API for LLM-driven insights into useful visualizations, anomalies, and key data patterns.

## Features

- Upload CSV files directly in the browser
- Parse and process telemetry data with PapaParse
- Interactive graphs with Chart.js (line, scatter, time-series, etc.)
- Clean, modern UI with shadcn/ui and TailwindCSS
- Gemini API integration for:
  - Recommended graphs based on data columns
  - Anomaly detection (spikes, drops, flatlines)
  - Insights into key ranges and trends
- Fully client-side (no backend or database required)
